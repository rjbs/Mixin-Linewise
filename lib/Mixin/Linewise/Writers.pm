=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Your::Pkg;
  use Mixin::Linewise::Writers -writers;

  sub write_handle {
    my ($self, $data, $handle) = @_;

    $handle->print("datum: $_\n") for @$data;
  }

Then:

  use Your::Pkg;

  Your::Pkg->write_file($data, $filename);

  Your::Pkg->write_string($data, $string);

  Your::Pkg->write_handle($data, $fh);

=head1 EXPORTS

C<write_file> and C<write_string> are exported by default.  Either can be
requested individually, or renamed.  They are generated by
L<Sub::Exporter|Sub::Exporter>, so consult its documentation for more
information.

Both can be generated with the option "method" which requests that a method
other than "write_handle" is called with the created IO::Handle.

If given a "binmode" option, any C<write_file> type functions will use
that as an IO layer, otherwise, the default is C<encoding(UTF-8)>.

  use Mixin::Linewise::Writers -writers => { binmode => "raw" };
  use Mixin::Linewise::Writers -writers => { binmode => "encoding(iso-8859-1)" };

=head2 write_file

  Your::Pkg->write_file($data, $filename);
  Your::Pkg->write_file($data, $options, $filename);

This method will try to open a new file with the given name.  It will then call
C<write_handle> with that handle.

An optional hash reference may be passed before C<$filename> with options.
The only valid option currently is C<binmode>, which overrides any
default set from C<use> or the built-in C<encoding(UTF-8)>.

Any arguments after C<$filename> are passed along after to C<write_handle>.

    # Check the file
    Carp::croak "no filename specified"           unless $filename;
    Carp::croak "'$filename' is not a plain file" if -e $filename && ! -f _;

    # Write out the file
    my $handle = IO::File->new($filename, ">:$options->{binmode}")
      or Carp::croak "couldn't write to file '$filename': $!";

    $invocant->write_handle($data, $handle, @_);
  }
}

=head2 write_string

  my $string = Your::Pkg->write_string($data);

C<write_string> will create a new handle on the given string, then call
C<write_handle> to write to that handle, and return the resulting string.
Because handles on strings must be octet-oriented, the string B<must contain
octets>.  It will be opened in the default binmode established by importing.
(See L</EXPORTS>, above.)

Any arguments after C<$data> are passed along after to C<write_handle>.
